## Description

I have created a Day Planner that allows users to add & save Events on a per hour basis. Future hours will be highlighted in green, the current hour will be highlighted in red and past hours will be shown in gray. Users will be able to leave the page and come back at any point to see their events, if the Users saves them via the button next to each hour-column. 

The user interface of the planner is designed to be intuitive and user-friendly, with a clean and simple layout that is easy to navigate. 

## Usage 

To review this Site Creation, you can review the notes in each section. Open the Chrome DevTools by pressing Command+Option+I (macOS) or Control+Shift+I (Windows). A console panel should open either below or to the side of the webpage in the browser.
